### Problem Statement:

Food waste is a huge problem in Canada: ["A whopping 58 percent of all food produced in Canada — 35.5 million tonnes — is lost
or wasted, according to a new report”](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/food-waste-report-second-harvest-1.4981728).

iFridge is a project that aims to reduce food waste. It is  a 'digital fridge' that matches what you have
in your fridge at home and allows users to easily keep track of their food inventory.

Users are notified when their food is about to expire, and having an easy visual of all the food that they have helps to avoid unnecessarily buying food when grocery shopping.

Extra features include the ability to create recipe ideas based on items in your fridge database and, time permitting, the ability to make your own shopping list.

### How to use:

#### 1) Requirements
- 1.1) XCode 11+ (Requires MacOS Catalina)

#### 2) Clone repo

- 2.1) `git clone https://github.com/shivani-mehan/iFridge.git`
- 2.2) Move into project directory
- 2.3) Launch project from `iFridge.xcworkspace` (using .xcodeproj will not work as it will not identify Firebase dependencies)

#### 3) Run the app

- 3.1) Choose a simulator device on the top left (iPhone 8 or above recommended) or connect your own iPhone
- 3.2) Press the play button on the top left to compile and run the app!

### Todo:

- More search filtering
- Extended error checking and validation
- Add images directly from the camera
- Create a shopping list
